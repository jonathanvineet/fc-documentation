### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  READ ALL WARNINGS BEFORE OPERATING AIRCRAFT    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Propeller Hazard**
> ⚠️ **DANGER:** Spinning propellers can cause severe injury or death.
> - ALWAYS remove propellers during configuration and testing
> - Keep hands, face, and loose objects away from propellers
> - Never approach armed aircraft
> - Propellers can continue spinning briefly after power cutoff

#### **Battery Hazard**
> ⚠️ **DANGER:** LiPo batteries can catch fire or explode if mishandled.
> - Never leave charging batteries unattended
> - Charge in fireproof container (LiPo bag)
> - Never charge damaged or swollen batteries
> - Store at storage voltage (3.8V per cell)
> - Dispose of damaged batteries properly

#### **Electrical Hazard**
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** High current can cause burns and start fires.
> - Always verify polarity before connecting power
> - Use appropriately rated wires and connectors
> - Never operate with damaged wiring
> - Disconnect battery when not flying

#### **Vision Hazard**
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** FPV operation requires visual observer.
> - Never fly FPV without visual line of sight observer (VLOS)
> - Maintain visual contact with aircraft at all times
> - Use spotter for long-range flights
> - FPV alone is NOT sufficient for safe operation
